Project PRIM: Pixel art manipulation
Base code from CGP Library by Damien Rohmer
Implemented by : Vannvatthana NORNG

To run this project, please do the following step

`` cd ../pixel_art_manipulation/manipulation
   make
  ./manip ``

Since I used makefile to run this project, it only works on Linux OS. 
In the GUI, there are buttons to select each limb that you want to manipulate. Check or uncheck the box "Sketch Mode" to switch between manipulation of the 3D model and navigation mode.
